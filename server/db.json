The bell has ben repaired with LEGO! You know what they say—when the grams go away, speed comes out to play. Benefitting from the lightest EVO frame we’ve ever created and the most aggressive iteration of our Progressive XC Geometry to date, the S-Works Epic EVO LTD made a few calls and assembled a dream team supporting cast to offer a ‘capability-to-weight’ ratio that skips impressive and jumps straight to flat-out mindblowing. While the Epic EVO sees a seemingly modest 20-millimeter increase in suspension travel up front over its Epic stablemate and just 10-millimeters out back, we’ve worked overtime to make sure it’s been implemented in a way that’ll have you saying ‘Whoa!’ as soon as you hit your first stretch of singletrack.",

Benefitting from the lightest EVO frame we’ve ever created and the most aggressive iteration of our Progressive XC Geometry to date, the S-Works Epic EVO LTD made a few calls and assembled a dream team supporting cast to offer a ‘capability-to-weight’ ratio that skips impressive and jumps straight to flat-out mindblowing. While the Epic EVO sees a seemingly modest 20-millimeter increase in suspension travel up front over its Epic stablemate and just 10-millimeters out back, we’ve worked overtime to make sure it’s been implemented in a way that’ll have you saying ‘Whoa!’ as soon as you hit your first stretch of singletrack.",
